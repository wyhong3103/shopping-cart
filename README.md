# Shopping Cart Project

Basically an e-commerce website. It would be great if you can review it B).

# Objective

To practice React Router & React Testing Library. Though I haven't done a lot of testing on this project, mainly because I have no idea how to do certain tests, and some tests are just too straightforward, and I don't feel the need to do it? Please review it lol!
